                Mosaics and azulejos have been an important part of Mexican culture for centuries. Mosaics were used in pre-Columbian times as a form of decorative art, and the Spanish introduced azulejos, a type of ceramic tilework that became popular during the colonial period. These intricate designs can be seen in churches, government buildings, and private homes throughout Mexico.
            </div>
            <div>
                Our NFTs draw inspiration from this rich history of decorative art in Mexico. Each attribute, from the color palette to the symbolic elements, has been carefully chosen to create a unique and meaningful representation of Mexican culture. Whether it's an Aztec-inspired geometric pattern or a traditional Mexican embroidery design, each NFT tells a story that is as vibrant and diverse as Mexico itself.

                        Generative NFTs are the new frontier in digital art, and at Mosaico, we've embraced this technology. Each of our 10,000 NFTs is generated through a programming process that allows for a near-infinite number of variations. Generative NFTs use algorithms to create unique images based on a set of rules and parameters. This means that no two NFTs in our collection are exactly alike, and each one is a true original.

                        To create our collection, we  created a set of attributes that represent different aspects of Mexican history, culture, and society, and then programmed these attributes into our generative process.
